The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.\n\nThe following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples of each:\n\nClassifying whole sentences: Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not\nClassifying each word in a sentence: Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)\nGenerating text content: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words\nExtracting an answer from a text: Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context\nGenerating a new sentence from an input text: Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text\nNLP isn‚Äôt limited to written text though. It also tackles complex challenges in speech recognition and computer vision, such as generating a transcript of an audio sample or a description of an image.\n\n**Why is it challenging?**\n\nComputers don‚Äôt process information in the same way as humans. For example, when we read the sentence ‚ÄúI am hungry,‚Äù we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as ‚ÄúI am hungry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am sad,‚Äù we‚Äôre able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine learning (ML) models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the model to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully about how this processing must be done. There has been a lot of research done on how to represent text, and we will look at some methods in the next chapter.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Transformers, what can they do?**\n\nIn this section, we will look at what Transformer models can do and use our first tool from the ü§ó Transformers library: the pipeline() function.\nTransformers are everywhere!\nTransformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks, like the ones mentioned in the previous section. Here are some of the companies and organizations using Hugging Face and Transformer models, who also contribute back to the community by sharing their models:\n\n**Companies using Hugging Face**\n\nThe ü§ó Transformers library provides the functionality to create and use those shared models. The Model Hub contains thousands of pretrained models that anyone can download and use. You can also upload your own models to the Hub!\n","metadata":{}}]}
